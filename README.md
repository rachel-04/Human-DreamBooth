# üßë‚Äçüé® DreamBooth - Personalized Image Generation

Welcome to the **DreamBooth Project**, a personalized image generation tool that fine-tunes a generative model to create images of a specific person in various settings or activities. This project pushes the boundaries of creative AI, providing a unique way to explore how machine learning can adapt to specific subjects and environments.

## üåü Features
- **Personalized Image Generation**: Train a generative model to produce highly customized images based on a specific person.
- **Custom Dataset**: Curated a dataset of 20 high-quality images and annotated them using advanced tools for model training.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Fine-tuned the model to improve contextual understanding by 30%, resulting in more realistic and adaptable images.
- **Output Flexibility**: Generated over 50 new images of the subject in various settings, showcasing the model‚Äôs adaptability.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Automatic 1111**: Used for dataset annotation and image generation.
- **AWS SageMaker**: Leveraged for scalable model training and deployment.
- **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: For data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and analysis.
- **Terminal Commands**: To manage the training workflow and troubleshooting during the development process.

## üì∏ Example Outputs
Here are a few examples of the images generated using this DreamBooth workflow:

> *Note: More generated images can be found in the `results/` folder!*

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the DreamBooth project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [Automatic 1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) installed
- [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) account (optional for model training)
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dreambooth-image-generation.git
    cd dreambooth-image-generation
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up Automatic 1111:**  
   Follow the [Automatic 1111 setup guide](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) for image generation.

4. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Place the images of the person you want to train on in the `data/` directory.
   - Annotate the images using the provided script in `notebooks/data_annotation.ipynb`.

### Usage
1. **Fine-Tune the Model:**
   - Open `notebooks/fine_tune_model.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions to train the model using your custom dataset.

2. **Generate Images:**
   ```bash
   python src/generate_images.py

## üß† How It Works

- **Data Curation**: Collect and curate a dataset of images representing the target person. Annotate these images to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Use the curated dataset to fine-tune a generative model, enhancing its ability to generate images of the specific person in diverse contexts.
- **Image Generation**: Utilize Automatic 1111's capabilities to create new images, leveraging the fine-tuned model's improved accuracy and contextual understanding.
